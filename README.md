# [Research Threats: Legal Threats Against African Security Researchers](https://threats.projectdinta.co)

An ongoing collection of legal threats made against African Security Researchers: over-reactions, demands, and cease & desist letters against good faith research. This project is in homage to [@attritionorg](https://github.com/attritionorg) great work in documenting historical researcher threats.

Includes many historical legal events copied with permission from [@attritionorg](https://github.com/attritionorg), originally at [https://attrition.org/errata/legal_threats/](https://attrition.org/errata/legal_threats/), which is still maintained. Crowd-sourcing this data through this repository is strongly recommended by all parties.

It doesn't matter that just about every company and product ships with vulnerabilities; security should be built into a product, rather than applied as a band-aid solution. Secure products are better, and a responsive security team should be an integral part of the development life cycle of that product. Vulnerabilities will happen; the response to those reports are what is important. Burning bridges and dismissing the good will of researchers offering to help secure your products does not benefit anyone.

## For Companies

Find examples below of **what *not* to do**.

Embrace security researchers. Learn from the documented examples in this archive. Researcher's who have been threatened by naive entities while legitimately working to improve the security of a product should be a source of collaboration; they may know more about your systems than you do. Put researchers who voluntarily submit bugs & vulnerabilities in touch with your internal security teams, work together to fix vulnerabilities, and coordinate the disclosure to your customers and the public.

- An **excellent coordinated disclosure** generally **boosts a company's public image** & customer confidence. It encourages researchers to work with you, not against you.

- A **negative experience** can exponentially generate **negative publicity, [sometimes even viral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)**.

- Providing researchers **safe harbor for reporting a vulnerability** to you is critical to working towards a **more secure product and ecosystem**.

Entities that engage researchers and respond quickly to security events are more likely to generate a positive experience.

Entities with no security response team, may be more likely to experience a negative disclosure event.

## For Researchers

Find examples below of **what *can* happen when things go wrong**.

Shield yourself from threats by always acting in good faith, following a company's vulnerability disclosure terms and visit the [EFF's Coders' Rights Project](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders). Work with companies and respect their timelines for implementing fixes. What may seem like an "easy fix" to you may be more complicated for a vendor maintaining multiple code trees across hundreds of platforms supporting thousands of customers.

Companies fear negative publicity; but companies also ship bugs & vulnerabilities out into the wild. Any publicity that may challenge the security aspect of a product may lead to legal threats or calls to law enforcement.

Engaging a company with an extensive, well managed security vulnerability program, will almost never lead to legal action. In fact, you may even be protected from violating a license agreement, while conducting good faith research, under safe habor.

Engaging a company that favors profit over ethics, or considers protecting the bottom line as more important than doing the right thing, may lead to challenges. Some companies welcome vulnerability reports. Some companies don't, but that does not make them immune from exploitation.

# Researcher's Rights: Threatened Security Researchers Walk of Fame & Hall of Shame

Below, you will find an ongoing & maintained collaborative effort to document some of the most *bizarre* reactions to otherwise trivial security events.

Historical archives were taken with explicit permission to continue wonderful work started by the folks at [@attritionorg](https://github.com/attritionorg), and are hosted in their originality at [https://attrition.org/errata/legal_threats/](https://attrition.org/errata/legal_threats/).

### Confirmed Threats Made Against Researchers

| **When** | **Entity** | **Researcher(s)** | **Topic** | **Status** |
|---|---|---|---|---|


The following incidents are related to the ones above, but "cross the line". They include incidents where it was not "security research", but rather activity that was considered a crime by current laws (at the time). Instead of following a more ethical approach or going the route of responsible disclosure, the researcher chose to research and disclose the details in a manner that was questionable. While the threat of law suit of such activity is frivilous to most, the companies are being prudent because the researcher in question likely did break laws in the process.

| **When** | **Company making threat** | **Researchers** | **Research Topic** | **Resolution/Status** |
|---|---|---|---|---|


Over the years, many talks have been cancelled for various reasons. Sometimes, the rumor of legal threats dominate the venue and/or news, but never happened. This table will list such events, to help clarify what happened. As time allows, any case of a security talk being cancelled will be added.

| **When** | **Company making request or threat** | **Researchers** | **Research Topic** | **Resolution/Status** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
